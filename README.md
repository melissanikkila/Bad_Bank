This app includes a home, withdraw, deposit, create account, login and data page.

# Installation
This program can be downloaded from this GitHub repository in order to be used on your personal device.

# Usage
This project can be edited in any coding program.  It was originally created in VS Code.  It can then be loaded in any browser by dragging and dropping the file into the browser (Chrome is recommended) or launched from a liver server of your choice.

# Roadmap
I intend to update this project to include back-end security, a functioning login page (currently only a place holder), and to make it mobile friendly.
